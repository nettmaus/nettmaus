- 👋 Hi, I’m @nettmaus

Hi, I’m @nettmaus, and I am following the template they gave me. Mostly. I have been Nettmaus for 30+ years. Before that, I was a mortal. While mortal, I got hooked on all things digital after messing around with code on my VIC-20. After I upgraded to an Atari 130XE, I was exploring Assembly and during a rather rough summoning session, something snapped and I decided to explore the vulnerable side of computers. Sometime on the 90s, I died. Nettmaus stole my body, performed the Abjuration of Gates, and now here I am.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

LINUX UBER ALLES. I installed Slackware 1.0 from 26 diskettes onto a (then brand new) Compaq 386 and never looked back. I have yet to encounter a computerized task that cannot be accomplished on a Linux system. Including most games.

I dabble in code, both living and long dead (sorry Forth... Fortran... Perl...). I was a PerlMonk, but don't practice it anymore - at least not in public (it is apparently indecent these days). I am coding agnostic, and as long as it's Turing Complete, I can probably write code in it once I figure out the syntax and symbols. Except, I can't write assembly sober, or without my bag of powdered silver and chicken's blood. 

Outside of writing code, I am a World-Builder and write fantasy short stories (and sometimes rotten poetry). I also like to learn new languages - both compter programming and human communication (C++, Draconian, Forth, German, Old Dryynsh, Perl, Russian, Spanish, etc. are all in my toolkit). When I feel particularly frisky, I make dangerous things out of Raspberry Pis. I am trying to put one into my dead robot's brain. I hear SLAM works on a Pi.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

I'm currently learning Java, Python, Swedish, and how to tie my shoes. My obsessive focus at this time is on creating a mod for Minecraft and after <strike>10</strike> <strike>11</strike> <strike>12</strike> 13 tries, I have finally made two blocks and an item. I know, learning Java while learning how to program mods in Java is the wrong way to do it™, but from my viewpoint, Java is just a (unnecessarily complicated) son of C++, and I eat a bowl of C++ties and milk every morning. It's the IDEs that get under my skin more than this Java stuff. Heck, NANO is almost too much of an IDE for me to swallow.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Nothing. I am an old-school nerd; highly agoraphobic and don't feel comfortable around strangers. One day when I grow up, I might. But now, not really.

- 📫 How to reach me ...

You could possibly reach me by meeting me on the street, or researching my digital footprint. I don't beg for attention, so I don't put my contact data out there.


--Sincerely,
T. Nett Maus
